# LoanInterest

This was part of a work assignment of a Data Scientist job application. In this assignment, I completed
a mini data science project that involves end-to-end pipeline from data cleaning, data preparing, featuring
exploration and engineering, model prototyping and selection, and evaluation. The goal of the project is to
predict the interest rate of loan applications.

The python script and results are summarized in the following Jupyter notebooks:
